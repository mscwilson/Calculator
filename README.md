Calculator
==========

This is a fairly basic calculator made with Python 2.7 and Tkinter (Tcl/Tk 8.5).
I wanted it to have everything I use on my physical Casio calculator.

Features include:
- Entered stuff is shown at the top, the answer is shown separately on evaluation
- A x10^ aka EXP button
- Brackets buttons
- Previous answer functionality
- Entry by button press or keyboard
- Delete and move cursor buttons for editing input

Because it's Tkinter it looks better on Windows than Mac.
